                     This involves testing different API endpoints, handling authentication and authorization, and verifying error handling mechanisms.
                     
8)UI testing
  Requirement - test the functionality or features of the software or application that comes into interaction with end-users
  Testing approach - Execute test scenarios that validate the accurate display of UI elements, their responsiveness to user actions, and proper navigation within the application. 
                     This includes verifying the layout, design, usability, and accessibility of the GUI, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.
                     
9)System testing
  Requirement - test the software in its entirety, as a complete product
  Testing approach - Perform comprehensive test scenarios that evaluate different aspects of the service, 
                     including features, performance, user experience, security, data integrity, error handling, scalability, compatibility, and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements
                     
10)White-box testing
  Requirement -  inspect the inner workings of a software system – code, infrastructure, and integrations with external systems.
  Testing approach - Execute code-level tests to validate the correctness of the internal structures, logic, and algorithms used in the music streaming service.
                     This includes testing edge cases, code coverage, and verifying the implementation of specific functionalities, ensuring the code operates as intended.
                     
11)Black-box testing
  Requirement - check how the system responds to expected and unexpected user actions, response time, usability, and reliability testing issues.
  Testing approach -  Execute test scenarios that validate the functionality of the music streaming service from an external perspective. 
                      This involves testing the application as a whole, focusing on inputs, outputs, and expected behavior, without considering the internal workings of the system.
                      
12)Acceptance testing
  Requirement - ensure that the end user can achieve the goals set in the business requirements
  Testing approach - Engage users and stakeholders to execute test scenarios that validate if the music streaming service fulfills the specified requirements, meets user expectations,
